# Quanta Quest
Quanta Quest is the journey of a quantum explorer to unlock the treasure by learning quantum physics and quantum computing.


## Introduction and Setting
In a world interwoven with quantum mysteries, you are a quantum explorer armed with knowledge and curiosity. Your mission is to navigate through quantum challenges to unlock the ultimate treasure,by solvingquantu operations and decrypt a hidden message embedded in the quantum realm.

## Motivation
Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field with the potential to revolutionize how we solve complex problems. However, the learning curve can be steep, often requiring a strong background in physics and mathematics. This game aims to break down these barriers by providing a fun, interactive way to grasp the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.

### Why Play This Game?
- **For Adventure**: As a quantum explorer, you are on a thrilling quest to find a hidden treasure.
- **For Learning**: Master the basics of quantum gates, superposition, and entanglement through hands-on exercises.
- **For Discovery**: Unveil the fascinating concept of quantum teleportation, a cornerstone of future quantum communication technologies.
- **For Application**: Gain practical skills that could be applied in real-world quantum computing problems.


## Learning Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience with basic quantum gate operations like X, Z, H, CX (Controlled Not).
- Learn the concept of quantum superposition and quantum entanglement.
- Discover the intriguing concept of quantum teleportation in a playful environment.

## How to Play
1. The player starts as a quantum explorer searching for a key to unlock a treasure chest.
2. Learn and apply various quantum gates to proceed through different levels.
3. Assemble a teleportation circuit to finally acquire the key.

## Endgame Objective
After mastering various quantum gates and learning about superposition and entanglement, you'll be tasked with assembling a teleportation circuit. Successfully executing this quantum operation will grant you the key to the treasure chest. What lies inside? That's for you to find out!

## Quantum Gates
- **X Gate**: Also known as a Pauli-X gate, it flips the state of a qubit.
- **Z Gate**: Known as a Pauli-Z gate, it applies a phase flip to the qubit.
- **H gate**: Creates a superpostion of two states.
- **CX (Controlled Not) gate**: It flips the target state if the control state is 1. It is used here to generate entanglement.

## Libraries Used

## Future Steps
We are commited to level up the game, add more quantum operations. We wish to include topics like quantum fourier transformation,  Shor's Algorithm and find a possible way to implement quantum error correction.
After finishing the educational part, we will also focus on the graphics desing to increase the attractiveness of the game.
