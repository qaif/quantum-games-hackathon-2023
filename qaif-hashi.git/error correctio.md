## What is Error Correction 
Errors in quantum systems can be of various types, including bit-flip errors (X-errors), phase-flip errors (Z-errors), or a combination of both. These errors can occur during operations on qubits or due to environmental interactions.

Quantum error correction employs special quantum codes, such as the well-known surface code, which encode qubits in a highly redundant manner. These codes introduce extra qubits (ancilla qubits) and entanglement to detect and correct errors.

To detect errors, syndrome measurements are performed on the ancilla qubits. These measurements reveal whether any errors have occurred and provide information about their type and location.

Based on the syndromes obtained from the measurements, error correction algorithms are applied to deduce and correct the errors that occurred on the data qubits. This involves adjusting the quantum state to reverse the errors.

The ultimate goal of quantum error correction is to enable fault-tolerant quantum computation. This means that even in the presence of a significant error rate, quantum algorithms can be executed reliably by continually applying error correction procedures.
