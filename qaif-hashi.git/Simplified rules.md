**Part 1:** 
In this part, you have to connect the numbered qubits (islands) with entanglement links (bridges) following these rules:
- Each qubit has a number that tells you how many other qubits it's entangled with.
- There can be at most one entangled links between two qubits.
- The entangled links cannot cross each other.
- The qubits can only be connected perpendiculary.
- The entangled links must connect all the qubits in a single group.
- The goal is to create a fully entangled map of qubits.

**Part 2:**
In this part, you have to detect and correct the errors on the qubits using the clues given by the bridges (here the syndrome measurements). A faulty syndrome measurement will display a different color. To correct the error, you have to press on the qubit to correct them. The goal is to restore the original state of the system.
